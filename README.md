Today I worked on my G1 Test Road Rules program in Java. I started by setting up the main menu where the user can choose to write the test or log in as admin. I used a Scanner to get user input and made sure the menu choices worked properly.
After that, I added the test questions. I made sure the final score only shows after the entire test is finished.
I also added pass/fail logic at the end. The user passes if they get at least 75% overall and at least one correct answer in each section. This helped me understand how to use if statements with multiple conditions.
I then worked on the admin login. I added a password check and showed an admin menu with options to add or remove questions. The add/remove features are not fully implemented.
